# My React + Vite Project

## 1. Project Overview

This project is a web application built using React and the Vite build tool. It aims to provide a modern, efficient, and user-friendly platform for [insert project purpose here]. The project leverages the power of React for building reusable UI components and Vite for a fast and optimized development experience.

## 2. Prerequisites

Before running the project locally, ensure that you
have the following software installed on your machine:

  `npm install`
This command will install all the project dependencies listed in the package.json file.

## 4. Development Server
To start the development server with Vite, run the following command:

This command will start the development server and automatically open your default web browser with the application running at `http://localhost:5173.`
If the browser doesn't open automatically, you can manually visit `http://localhost:5173` to access the application.

## 5. Building for Protection
